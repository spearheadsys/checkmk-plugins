 This check checks for machines in pending reboot. 
 You need to install the plugin {pending_reboot.ps1}
 into the {plugins} directory of your windows agent.  
 This check was tested with Windows 2008 Server and Windows 7 
 and must have PowerShell installed. On Windows x64 is 
 recommended to use x64 agent. As always you must set
 "set-executionpolicy remotesigned" on monitored host.

 The check gets critical if the pending reboot status have 24 
 hours age and warning if the pending reboot status has more 
 than 12 hour age.
 Both limits are definable in Wato under "Parameters for 
 Inventorized Checks", "Applications, Processes & Services".

inventory:
 One service will be created for each host running the plugin.

perfdata:
 None.

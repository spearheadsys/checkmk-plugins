 You need to install the plugin {SPH-Exchange-MailboxSize.ps1}
 into the {plugins} directory of your windows agent.  
 This check was tested with Exchange 2010 and must have PowerShell
 installed.

 if over 1500MB. Both are definable in Wato under "Parameters for 
 Inventorized Checks", "Applications, Processes & Services".

 One service will be created for each user mailbox where the 
 {SPH-Exchange-MailboxSize.ps1} plugin produces a non-empty output.

perfdata:
 One variable: {size}: the current size of the mailbox in MB.

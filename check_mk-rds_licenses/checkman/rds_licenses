 into the {plugins} directory of your windows agent in 
 case of Win 2008 Server. In case of Win 2012 Server
 in plugin directory must be copied elevate_shell.ps1
 and the rds_licenses_2008.ps1 must be copied into 
 check_mk agent folder and the user which run the check_mk
 service must be allowed to elevate privileges.   
 This check was tested with Windows 2008 Server  
 and must have PowerShell installed. On Windows x64 is 
 recommended to use x64 agent. As always you must set
 "set-executionpolicy remotesigned" on monitored host.

 The check gets critical if the usage percentage is above 
 95 percents and warning if the usage percentage is above
 90 percents.
 Both limits are definable in Wato under "Parameters for 
 Inventorized Checks", "Applications, Processes & Services".

 This check checks for individual exchange database sizes.

 into the {plugins} directory of your windows agent.
 This check was tested with Exchange 2010 and must have PowerShell
 installed.

 The check gets critical if there mailbox is over 20000 MB and warning
 if over 2500MB. Both are definable in Wato under "Parameters for
 Inventorized Checks", "Applications, Processes & Services".

 One service will be created for each database where the
 {sph-exchange-database-size.ps1} plugin produces a non-empty output.

perfdata:
 One variable: {size}: the current size of the database in MB.
